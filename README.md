# About Pharmacy Project
A simple program to manage products in general and in particular for pharmacy products,
It is written in Java and there is an API also in Java,
Works on Windows <br />
It works fine but I forgot where I put the schema 😂
That's okay, I'll fix this problem.

### Here are some pictures of my program:

1. **When running, the main interface appears of course 🥲:**
    
    *   As you can see, I can view products, invoices, enter an invoice...
    
    *   There is a main menu to add employees (soon)

2. **Here I can add an invoice with simple details as shown:**

<br />

3. **It asks me to enter the invoice details completely:**

    * If the product is not in the warehouse, it will ask me to enter it and then complete the process
    
    * That's cool 😊

4. **This is a great masterpiece 😉, you can view products, add new products and modify them like this...:**

5. **Here you can view the details of the products and add or modify features and delete them of course 😁:**

6. **Don't forget this interface, it's important:**
    *   Display products in a beautiful layout
    *   You can search easily
